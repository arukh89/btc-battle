# TX Battle Royale (React + Vite)

This is the React + TypeScript (Vite) conversion of your TX Battle Royale Mini App.
- Frontend (this repo) should be built and deployed to Netlify (or similar).
- Backend remains on Replit: set BACKEND_URL accordingly.

IMPORTANT:
- Put your signed `farcaster.json` into `public/.well-known/farcaster.json` before deploying.
- Update `public/.well-known/farcaster.json` with your signed manifest (do NOT modify signature/header/payload).
